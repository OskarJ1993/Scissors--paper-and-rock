### Forking
Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository, you can make a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account. This means we can view or make changes without making the changes affecting the original.

Log into GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
At the top of the Repository there is a "Fork" button about the "Settings" button on the menu.
You should now have a new copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.


### Cloning
Making a Local Clone

Log into your GitHub then find the gitpod repository

Under the repository name there is a button that says "Clone or download". Click on this button.

If cloning with HTTPS "Clone with HTTPS", copy this link.

Open Gitbash
